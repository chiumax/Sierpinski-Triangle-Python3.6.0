# Sierpinski's Triangle Python ðŸ”º
Sierpinski's Triangle created recursively using Python by dumblole.

When using, run the main.py file for better user experience.
Otherwise, just run striangle.py using this syntax:

`triangle(degree,length,'color')`

Take note that running striangle.py will not center the triangle and will not
ask the user for inputs.

If you have a problem with the window of the triangle closing everytime after clicking it, just remember 
that it's set to close on click. If you want to avoid that, just click it's title bar and drag it around.
Or open the window through the task bar.
